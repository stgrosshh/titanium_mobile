summary: |
    Provides support for Android push notifications.
description: |
    The CloudPush module supports Android push notifications for a device by providing a connection
    to the push notification server to the device to receive push notifications and to optionally
    present a tray notification to the user when a new push notification is received.

    This module is only used to receive push notifications.  For information on configuring your
    project to send push notifications, see <Modules.Cloud.PushNotifications>.

    #### Push Protocols

    As of Release 3.2.0, the CloudPush module only supports Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for push
    notifications. MQTT support is deprecated and support was removed in Release 3.2.0. Upgrade your
    application to use the GCM protocol.

    GCM supports devices that run Android 2.2 and later, and requires that the Google Play Store
    application be installed. For pre-4.0 devices, the user is required to set up their Google
    account.

    #### Getting Started

    To use the CloudPush module in your JavaScript code, you need to require it in and
    get a device token with the `retrieveDeviceToken` method to enable push notifications with Arrow Push.
    In your project's `tiapp.xml`, you need to add some keys to configure push notifications.

    Note that this module is not included in the Titanium namespace, but it is bundled with the Titanium SDK as of
    version 2.0.0. To use it, you must require it, like this:

        var CloudPush = require('ti.cloudpush');

    Then, call the `retrieveDeviceToken` method to get a unique token specific to that device and
    Arrow DB application.  This token is used with [Arrow PushNotifications calls](Modules.Cloud.PushNotifications)
    to subscribe and unsubscribe the device to push notification channels.

    Once the device is subscribed to at least one push channel, listen to the module's `callback`,
    `trayClickLaunchedApp`, and `trayClickFocusedApp` events to monitor for incoming push notifications.

    This module must also be added to the modules section in your tiapp.xml. This can be done using the Modules list in
    the Titanium Studio TiApp Editor, or by editing the XML directly and adding the following line to the modules
    element:

        <module platform="android">ti.cloudpush</module>

    Your app must prove that it is allowed to talk to Arrow. This keeps your data secure by preventing anyone from
    making requests to Arrow that impersonate your app.

    Titanium Studio creates a pair of keys (Development and Production) for each Titanium application depending on the
    user preference specified during new project creation. This pair of keys will be stored in `tiapp.xml` and one of the
    keys will be used during application build depending on the build type (development or production).

    To use push notifications, in the `tiapp.xml` file, you need to specify the Arrow Push keys and push
    type. The supported properties in `tiapp.xml` are:

        <!-- Property keys for Arrow Push (required) -->
        <property name="acs-api-key-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-api-key-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-api-key" type="string">YOUR API KEY HERE</property>

    If a deployment-specific setting is provided (production or development) then that value will be used for the current deployment environment.

    *WARNING*: The default properties of this module are used until you set a property for the first time. Because the
    properties are persisted to the device settings (via <Titanium.App.Properties>), the most recent value you set will
    always be used.

    #### Virtual Private Cloud Configuration

    If you are using a virtual private cloud (VPC), you need to configure your Arrow Push dispatcher
    URL in order to send push notifications with GCM.  In the `tiapp.xml` file, add the `acs-push-api-url`
    application property and set the node text to the push dispatcher URL provided to you.  The URL may
    be the same as your custom ArrowDB endpoint and have deployment-specific settings, that is, two
    URLs--one for production and another for the development environment.

        <ti:app>
            <property name="acs-push-api-url-production">https://api-prod.fooinc.com</property>
            <property name="acs-push-api-url-development">https://api-dev.fooinc.com</property>
        </ti:app>

    #### Grouped Notifications

    If the device receives multiple push notifications from the application, Android can group these
    notifications together as one notification.

    To use grouped notifications, add a grouped notification template to either the `tiapp.xml` file
    or the `i18n` folder for internationalized versions:

    `tiapp.xml`:

        <property name="acs-grouped-notification-message-development" type="string">You have $number$ unread messages.</property>
        <property name="acs-grouped-notification-message-production" type="string">You have $number$ unread messages.</property>
        -or-
        <property name="acs-grouped-notification-message" type="string">You have $number$ unread messages.</property>

    `i18n/es/strings.xml` (example for Spanish):

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <resources>
           <string name="acs_grouped_notification_message">Tienes $number$ mensajes no leidos.</string>
        </resources>

    The `$number$` variable indicates the number of unread messages.

        summary: A JSON string of your data payload. Use JSON.parse to turn this into an object you can use.
        type: String
    
  - name: callback
    summary: Fired whenever a push notification is received.
    description: |
        If your application is not running when a push is received, the push will be saved in a queue until the next
        time you add an event listener for this.

        This will only be fired once per push notification.

        This event will be fired at different times depending on your settings and the application's present state
        (foreground, background, or not running at all). When [focusAppOnPush](Modules.CloudPush.focusAppOnPush) is true, this
        will fire as soon as you receive a push. When [showTrayNotification](Modules.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) is true, this
        will fire as soon as the user touches the tray notification to focus your application. Or, if
        [showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused](Modules.CloudPush.showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused) is false, and your application is
        in the foreground, it will be called right away. If both [focusAppOnPush](Modules.CloudPush.focusAppOnPush)
        and [showTrayNotification](Modules.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) are false, this will fire the next time your
        application is launched and you add an event listener for it.

        You can use the [trayClickLaunchedApp](Modules.CloudPush.trayClickLaunchedApp) and
        [trayClickFocusedApp](Modules.CloudPush.trayClickFocusedApp) events to distinguish between the various ways
        a push notification can return a user to your application.

examples:
  - title: Listening for Push Notifications
    example: |
        This example lets the application retrieve the device token and listens for several events
        to monitor incoming push notifications.

            var CloudPush = require('ti.cloudpush');
            CloudPush.retrieveDeviceToken({
                success: function deviceTokenSuccess(e) {
                    // Use this device token with Ti.Cloud.PushNotifications calls
                    // to subscribe and unsubscribe to push notification channels
                    Ti.API.info('Device Token: ' + e.deviceToken);
                },
                error: function deviceTokenError(e) {
                    alert('Failed to register for push! ' + e.error);
                }
            });
            // These events monitor incoming push notifications
            CloudPush.addEventListener('callback', function (evt) {
                alert(evt.payload);
            });
            CloudPush.addEventListener('trayClickLaunchedApp', function (evt) {
                Ti.API.info('Tray Click Launched App (app was not running)');
            });
            CloudPush.addEventListener('trayClickFocusedApp', function (evt) {
                Ti.API.info('Tray Click Focused App (app was already running)');
            });
