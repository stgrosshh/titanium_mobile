name: Titanium.App.Android.R
summary: |
    The Titanium binding of the native Android `R` class, giving access to application resources.
description: |
    The properties and sub-properties of this object relate directly to the native application 
    resources `R` class, and thus have the same syntax. For more information, refer to the 
    official documentation on the Android Developer website about 
    [accessing application resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html).  
    
    For example, if the file 
    `platform/android/res/drawable/icon.png` exists in the project, it can be accessed using its 
    integer id, as follows.
    
        var resid = Titanium.App.Android.R.drawable.icon;

    To access system-wide resources, rather than application resources, use <Titanium.Android.R> 
    instead.
    
    Starting in Titanium SDK 7.3.0, this API exposes all Android related R classes
    for the usage in Hyperloop. For example, it can be used to access `menu` resources
    as part of native user interfaces, e.g. `BottomNavigationView` or `RecyclerView`.
    See an example in the [Hyperloop Sample App](https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples) for details!
