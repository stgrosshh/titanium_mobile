# Welcome to your Titanium Angular project

> ⚠️ Titanium Angular is currently only available as a preview and under ongoing development. Expect things to be broken or APIs to change as this project matures. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

This project was created using the default Angular project template. It is a very simple single view app that demonstrates basic concepts such as using Titanium elements in Angular and data and event binding to Angular components.

For more examples check out the sample app in the titanium-angular repo: <https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-angular/tree/master/ti-angular-example>.
